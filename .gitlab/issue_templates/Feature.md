    Please do NOT open a feature request unless you are willing to do
    some work to make it happen.

    Feeder is Free Software - which means you have the power to change
    it to make it better *for you*.

    It is NOT a charity project where the author writes code because
    you ask him to.

    Essentially, if you open a feature request, I expect you to follow
    it up with a patch to implement the feature.
